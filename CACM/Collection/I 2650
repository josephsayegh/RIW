Order-n Correction for Regular Languages A method is presented for calculating a string B, belonging to a given regular language L,  which is "nearest" (in number of edit operations) to a given input string a.  B is viewed as a reasonable  "correction" for the possibly erroneous string a, where a was originally intended to be a string of L.   The calculation of B by the method presented requires time proportional to |a|, the number of characters  in a.  The method should find applications in information retrieval, artificial intelligence, and spelling  correction systems. error correction, regular languages, regular events, finite state automata, compiler error recovery,  spelling correction, string best match problem, correction, corrector, errors, nondeterministic finite-state  automata

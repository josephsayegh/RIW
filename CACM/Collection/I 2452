Evaluation and Selection of File Organization-A Model and System This work first discusses the factors that affect file (data base) organization performance,  an elusive subject, and then presents a methodology, a model and a programmed system to estimate primarily  total storage costs and average access time of several file organizations, given a specific data base,  query characterization and device-related specifications.  Based on these estimates, an appropriate file  structure may be selected for the specific situation.  The system is a convenient tool to study file  structures and to facilitate as much as possible the process of data base structure design and evaluation. file organization, file structures, file management, file organization performance, file organization  model, file structure design, secondary index organization, simulation, data base, access time, storage  requirement, data base analysis, data management

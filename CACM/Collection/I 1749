The Structure of the "THE"-Multiprogramming System A multiprogramming system is described in which all activities are divided over a number of  sequential processes.  These sequential processes are placed at various hierarchical levels, in each  of which one or more independent abstractions have been implemented.  The hierarchical structure proved  to be vital for the verification of the logical soundness of the design and the correctness of its implementation. operating system, multiprogramming system, system hierarchy, system structure, real-time debugging,  program verification, synchronizing primitives, cooperating sequential processes, system levels, input-output  buffering, multiprogramming, processor sharing, multiprocessing

A Recurrence Scheme for Converting from One Orthogonal Expansion into Another A generalization of a scheme of Hamming for converting a polynomial Pn(x) into a Chebyshev  series is combined with a recurrence scheme of Clenshaw for summing any finite series whose terms satisfy  a three-term recurrence formula.   orthogonal expansions, series interconversion, recurrence schemes, Hamming recurrence, Clenshaw  recurrence, three-term recurrence, five-term recurrence, Chebyshev series

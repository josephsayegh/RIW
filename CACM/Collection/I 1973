The Linear Quotient Hash Code A new method of hash coding is presented and is shown to possess desirable attributes.  Specifically, the algorithm is simple, efficient, and exhaustive, while needing little time per probe and using few probes per lookup.  Performance data and implementation hints are also given. hashing, hash code, scatter storage, calculated address, search, table, lookup, symbol table, keys

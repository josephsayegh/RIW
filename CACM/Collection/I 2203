Key-to-Address Transform Techniques: A Fundamental Performance Study on Large Existing Formatted  Files The results of a study of eight different key-to-address transformation methods applied to  a set of existing files are presented.  As each method is applied to a particular file, load factor and  bucket size are varied over a wide range.  In addition, appropriate variables pertinent only to a specific  method take on different values.  The performance of each method is summarized in terms of the number  of accesses required to get to a record and the number of overflow records created by a transformation.   Peculiarities of each method are discussed.  Practical guidelines obtained from the results are stated.   Finally, a proposal for further quantitative fundamental study is outlined. hashing, hashing techniques, hashing methods, hash coding, keys, key transformation, key-to-address  transformation, direct addressing, direct access method, randomizing, random access,file addressing,  file organizations, file structures, scatter storage, search, collisions, clusters, information retrieval

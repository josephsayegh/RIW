Three Criteria for Designing Computing Systems to Facilitate Debugging The designer of a computing system should adopt explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting  proposed system features.  Three possible criteria of this kind are input recordability, input specifiability,  and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  These criteria imply that a user can, if he desires, either  know or control all the influences affecting the content and extent of his computer's output.  To define  the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract machine of a programming language and the notion  of a virtual computer are explained.  Examples of applications of the criteria concern the reading of  a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems,  and the assignment of capability indexes. computer design, computer design criteria, computer systems, computer systems design, input equipment,  input equipment design, operating systems, operating systems design, multiprogramming, multiprogrammed  systems, multiprogrammed system design, virtual computers, programming languages, programming language  design, program semantics, programming language semantics, determinism, reproducibility, repeatability,  deterministic computers, protection, memory protection, information security, information privacy, computing  reliability, debugging, program debugging, program testing, parallel processing, parallel programming,  multiprocessing

Boolean matrix Methods for the Detection of Simple Precedence Grammars A mechanical procedure is derived for determining whether a given context-free phrase structure  grammar is a simple precedence grammar.  This procedure consists of elementary operations on suitably  defined Boolean matrices.  Application of the procedure to operator grammars is also given. syntax analysis, precedence analysis, simple precedence grammar, simple precedence language, operator  grammar, operator precedence, compilers, bounded-context syntactic analysis, Boolean matrices, relations

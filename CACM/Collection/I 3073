Communicating Sequential Processes This paper suggests that input and output are basic primitives of programming and that parallel  composition of communicating sequential processes is a fundamental program structuring method.  When  combined with a development of Dijkstra's guarded command, these concepts are surprisingly versatile.   Their use is illustrated by sample solutions of a variety of familiar programming exercises.

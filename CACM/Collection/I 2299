An Extensible Editor for a Small Machine with Disk Storage A design philosophy for developing a sophisticated utility program is illustrated by the actual  design and implementation of a text editor.  A versatile data structure is employed so that only a small  number of programmed subroutines are necessary for all types of data manipulation.  Such a data structure  is described, and its merits are illustrated by the ease with which powerful extensions can be implemented  in terms of a few basic editing function. command processing, context searching, executive program, garbage collection, interpreter, list  processing, macro language, paging, parameter substitution, recursion, state table, storage allocation,  string manipulation, text editing, virtual memory

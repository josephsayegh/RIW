On the Conversion of Programs to Decision Tables: Method and Objectives The problems of converting programs to decision tables are investigated.  Objectives of these  conversions are mainly program debugging and optimization in practice.  Extensions to the theory of computation  and computability are suggested. decision tables, program optimization, debugging, semantics, theory of programming, systems analysis

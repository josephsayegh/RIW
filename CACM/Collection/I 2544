Automatic Error bounds for Simple Zeros of Analytic Functions The Cauchy-Ostrowski theorem on convergence of Newton iterates for an analytic function in  one variable is extended to include computational errors using complex interval arithmetic. Several numerical  examples are given for polynomials with real and complex roots and one example for the Bessel function  of the first kind. real intervals, complex intervals, real interval arithmetic, complex interval arithmetic, Newton's  method, Cauchy-Ostrowski theorem, zeros of polynomials, zeros of Bessel functions

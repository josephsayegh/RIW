Virtual Memory, Processes, and Sharing in MULTICS Some basic concepts involved in the design of the MULTICS operating system are introduced.   MULTICS concepts of processes, address space, and virtual memory are defined and the use of paging and  segmentation is explained.  The means by which users may share procedures and data is discussed and the  mechanism by which symbolic references are dynamically transformed into virtual machine addresses is  described in detail. virtual memory, information sharing, shared procedures, data sharing, dynamic linking, segmentation,  paging, multiprogramming, storage management, storage hierarchies, file maintenance

Dynamic Storage Allocation Systems In many recent computer system designs, hardware facilities have been provided for easing the  problems of storage allocation.  A method of characterizing dynamic storage allocation systems-according  to the functional capabilities provided and the underlying techniques used-is presented.  The basic purpose  of the paper is to provide a useful perspective from which the utility of various hardware facilities  may be assessed.  A brief survey of storage allocation facilities in several representative computer  systems is included as an appendix. segmentation, paging, multiprogramming, storage allocation, storage management, virtual memories,  storage fragmentation, storage hierarchies, addressing mechanisms
